            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien ( 3 January 1892 – 2 September 1973) was an English writer and philologist. He was the author of the high fantasy works The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.

From 1925 to 1945, Tolkien was the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and a Fellow of Pembroke College, both at the University of Oxford. He then moved within the same university to become the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College, and held these positions from 1945 until his retirement in 1959. Tolkien was a close friend of C. S. Lewis, a co-member of the informal literary discussion group The Inklings. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972.

After Tolkien's death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. These, together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda and, within it, Middle-earth. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term legendarium to the larger part of these writings.

While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the tremendous success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings ignited a profound interest in the fantasy genre and ultimately precipitated an avalanche of new fantasy books and authors. As a result, he has been popularly identified as the "father" of modern fantasy literature and is widely regarded as one of the most influential authors of all time.</p></section>

        <ul>
            <li>He was born in South Africa, and then came to settle in England as a child. The family was originally Baptist but Tolkien’s father died and his mother converted the family to Roman Catholicism.</li>
            <li>His best friend, or certainly one of them, was fellow fantasy writer C. S. Lewis. But he thought Lewis was too allegorical for his taste.</li>
            <li>As an Oxford Don Tolkien was a world-class expert in Old English language and sagas, especially sagas imported from pre-Christian Northern European cultures, such as “Beowulf.” And yet he was ultimately 10,000 x more famous as a writer of fantasy, something he never really envisioned or sought very much.</li>
            <li>Though his best prose sounds almost Shakespearean, he was about the only writer who didn’t appreciate the comparison. For Tolkien, Shakespeare was too “modern”; Tolkien wanted to be more ancient than that — a Northern Homer.</li>
            <li>He was a soldier in World War One (called “the Great War” at the time); he had a number of friends who never came back, giving him a taste of how horrible war could be, and sometimes his writing reflects the horror of war.</li>
            <li>is fame happened to him late in life. He invented whole new languages and wrote sagas for the imaginary people who spoke these languages for…literally… decades before his fictional works were ever published.</li>
            <li>he Hobbit, originally written to amuse his children, was the turning point, published in the 1940s. By the time he had worldwide success with The Lord of the Rings… in the 1960s… he had only a few years to live</li>
            <li>Tolkien was a fairly skilled artist and painter, and he did his own illustrations for early editions of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, but later fantasy artists were to contribute greatly to the covers and other illustrations.</li>
